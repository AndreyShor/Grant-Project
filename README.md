## Intro 

Government grants are essential to advancing aspi-
rations, supporting research and driving progress in
various sectors . They can provide resources for
companies to carry out projects or provide services
that they may not be able to afford otherwise. As
government grants do not have to be repaid, there is
a lot of competition companies have to go through
before actually receiving them. In November 2020 the
UK government published data about all the grants
they make in an effort to collect and standardize this
information using the 360Giving data standard.
The aim of this project is to analyse this data to
answer questions about how the government decides
where to give these grants. Insights from the data set
will help understand grantmaking in the UK and how
to improve it through three main research questions.

1) How does UK government grantmaking vary by
theme or topic? How have these topics changed
over time?
2) Do different government departments fund the
same organisations?
3) How well do grants reflect the priorities and aims
of the government?
4) Can we observe the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on government grant allocation?
5) Can we observe the impact of the Energy Bill
Support Scheme (EBSS) on government grant
allocation ?
