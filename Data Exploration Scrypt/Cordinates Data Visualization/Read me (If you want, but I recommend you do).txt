Three files contains different types of map plots across years.

To view the interactive maps clone the repository and open in your file explorer, or when you click on for example "data_2016-2017_heatmap.html" on GitHub page and it shows a bunch of codes at the top right there is a download bottom which will allow you to download raw file,  it will download the html file on your pc to view :)

Heads-up: the interactive maps (does not include interactive heatmaps) can be slow to load for 2029-2020, 2020-2021, 2021-2022, 2022-2023 because they contain around 200000 points. 
Can potentially make your pc or laptop go boom! ------- just joking :)

Another heads-up: the code included only contains the plotting part, does not include importing datasets. (data_1617 in the code refers to the imported dataset for year 2016-2017)
